# LLM Agent Integration with Advanced Biological Parameters

## Overview

Yes, **all the new biological parameters are now passed to the LLM agents**! The implementation provides comprehensive biological context to both individual nanobots and the Queen coordinator, enabling sophisticated decision-making based on real tumor biology.

## Individual Nanobot LLM Integration

### Enhanced Decision-Making Context

Each nanobot now receives **extensive biological information** when making decisions:

#### 1. **Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) Information**
```python
# Check BBB permeability of nearest vessel
nearest_vessel = self.model.geometry.find_nearest_vessel(tuple(self.position))
bbb_permeability = nearest_vessel.bbb_permeability if nearest_vessel else 0.1
```

**LLM receives:**
- BBB permeability factor (0.05-0.3)
- Vessel type information
- Drug transport efficiency

#### 2. **Tumor Heterogeneity Analysis**
```python
# Analyze nearby tumor cells by type
nearby_cells = [c for c in self.model.geometry.get_living_cells() 
               if distance < 50.0]

cell_type_counts = {}
for cell_type in CellType:
    cell_type_counts[cell_type.value] = len([
        c for c in nearby_cells if c.cell_type == cell_type
    ])
avg_resistance = np.mean([c.resistance_level for c in nearby_cells])
```

**LLM receives:**
- **Stem cells**: Count and location (highest priority targets)
- **Differentiated cells**: Normal sensitivity targets
- **Resistant cells**: Developed resistance areas
- **Invasive cells**: More sensitive targets
- **Average resistance level**: Overall resistance in area

#### 3. **Immune System Signals**
```python
# Get immune system signals
ifn_gamma = self.model.microenv.get_concentration_at('ifn_gamma', tuple(self.position))
tnf_alpha = self.model.microenv.get_concentration_at('tnf_alpha', tuple(self.position))
perforin = self.model.microenv.get_concentration_at('perforin', tuple(self.position))

# Analyze nearby immune cells
nearby_immune = [c for c in self.model.geometry.immune_cells 
                if c.is_active and distance < 50.0]
immune_activity = np.mean([c.activation_level for c in nearby_immune])
```

**LLM receives:**
- **IFN-gamma**: T-cell activity levels
- **TNF-alpha**: Macrophage activity levels  
- **Perforin**: NK cell cytotoxicity levels
- **Immune cell count**: Active immune cells nearby
- **Activation levels**: Average immune cell activation

#### 4. **Multi-Drug Therapy Context**
```python
# Get multi-drug concentrations
drug_a = self.model.microenv.get_concentration_at('drug_a', tuple(self.position))
drug_b = self.model.microenv.get_concentration_at('drug_b', tuple(self.position))
```

**LLM receives:**
- **Drug A**: Primary therapeutic agent concentration
- **Drug B**: Secondary/synergistic agent concentration
- **Combination effects**: Potential for synergistic therapy

### Enhanced LLM Prompt Structure

The nanobot LLM prompt now includes:

```
CURRENT STATUS:
- Position, drug payload, deliveries made

LOCAL MICROENVIRONMENT:
- Oxygen, drug concentration, pheromones

IMMUNE SYSTEM SIGNALS:
- IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, Perforin levels

MULTI-DRUG THERAPY:
- Drug A and Drug B concentrations

TUMOR CELL ANALYSIS (within 50µm):
- Total cells, stem cells, differentiated, resistant, invasive
- Average resistance level

IMMUNE CELL ACTIVITY:
- Active immune cells nearby
- Average activation level

BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER:
- Nearest vessel BBB permeability

STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:
- Stem cells require 3x more drug
- Immune cells make tumor cells more vulnerable
- High resistance areas need sustained delivery
- BBB restricts drug transport
- Multi-drug combinations overcome resistance
```

## Queen Nanobot LLM Integration

### Strategic Coordination Context

The Queen nanobot receives **comprehensive tumor-wide statistics**:

#### 1. **Global Tumor Statistics**
```python
stats = self.model.geometry.get_tumor_statistics()
cell_type_dist = stats.get('cell_type_distribution', {})
immune_dist = stats.get('immune_cell_distribution', {})
```

#### 2. **Priority Region Analysis**
```python
# Calculate priority regions
stem_cell_regions = []
high_resistance_regions = []
immune_active_regions = []

for cell in self.model.geometry.get_living_cells():
    if cell.cell_type == CellType.STEM_CELL:
        stem_cell_regions.append(cell.position[:2])
    if cell.resistance_level > 0.5:
        high_resistance_regions.append(cell.position[:2])
```

#### 3. **Enhanced Strategic Guidance**
The Queen's LLM prompt includes:

```
TUMOR STATUS:
- Total cells, living cells, survival rate

CELL TYPE DISTRIBUTION:
- Stem cells, differentiated, resistant, invasive counts

IMMUNE SYSTEM STATUS:
- T cells, macrophages, NK cells, dendritic counts

STRATEGIC PRIORITIES:
- Stem cell regions (sustained drug delivery needed)
- High resistance areas (multi-drug approach needed)
- Immune active zones (synergistic opportunities)

NANOBOT STATUS:
- Total deliveries, drug delivered, cells killed

COORDINATION STRATEGY:
1. Direct nanobots to stem cell regions
2. Avoid over-concentrating in treated areas
3. Leverage immune-active regions
4. Consider BBB permeability for reload routes
```

## Intelligent Decision-Making Examples

### Scenario 1: Stem Cell Targeting
**LLM receives:** "Stem cells: 3 (highly resistant, need more drug)"
**LLM decision:** Prioritize targeting stem cells if payload sufficient

### Scenario 2: Immune Synergy
**LLM receives:** "Immune activity: 0.8 (high), IFN-gamma: 2.5"
**LLM decision:** Leverage immune-active regions for synergistic effects

### Scenario 3: BBB Challenge
**LLM receives:** "BBB permeability: 0.05 (very restrictive)"
**LLM decision:** Plan reload routes through leaky tumor vessels

### Scenario 4: Resistance Management
**LLM receives:** "Average resistance: 0.7 (high), Resistant cells: 5"
**LLM decision:** Use multi-drug approach or sustained delivery

## Biological Intelligence Features

### 1. **Adaptive Targeting**
- LLMs prioritize stem cells when payload is sufficient
- Avoid high-resistance areas when payload is low
- Leverage immune-active regions for synergistic effects

### 2. **BBB-Aware Navigation**
- Consider BBB permeability when planning routes
- Prioritize leaky tumor vessels for drug delivery
- Account for drug transport efficiency

### 3. **Resistance Management**
- Detect high-resistance regions
- Adapt strategy based on resistance levels
- Use multi-drug combinations when appropriate

### 4. **Immune Synergy**
- Identify immune-active regions
- Coordinate with immune cell activity
- Maximize synergistic therapeutic effects

## Performance Considerations

### Efficient Data Collection
- **Spatial queries**: Only analyze cells within 50µm radius
- **Cached statistics**: Reuse tumor statistics across nanobots
- **Selective updates**: Only update when significant changes occur

### LLM Optimization
- **Structured prompts**: Clear, concise biological context
- **Action constraints**: Limited to 4 actions (target, follow_trail, explore, return)
- **Timeout handling**: Graceful fallback to heuristic behavior

## Future Enhancements

### Potential LLM Improvements
1. **Dynamic prompt adaptation**: Adjust prompt complexity based on situation
2. **Learning from outcomes**: Incorporate success/failure feedback
3. **Multi-agent communication**: Direct nanobot-to-nanobot coordination
4. **Personalized strategies**: Different LLM personalities for different roles

### Advanced Biological Integration
1. **Real-time imaging data**: Incorporate MRI/CT information
2. **Patient-specific parameters**: Personalized tumor characteristics
3. **Drug interaction modeling**: Complex multi-drug synergies
4. **Temporal dynamics**: Long-term resistance evolution

## Conclusion

The LLM agents now have **comprehensive access to all advanced biological parameters**, enabling sophisticated decision-making that reflects real tumor biology. This creates a powerful platform for:

- **Intelligent drug delivery**: Context-aware targeting strategies
- **Adaptive resistance management**: Dynamic response to resistance
- **Immune system coordination**: Synergistic therapeutic approaches
- **BBB-aware navigation**: Realistic drug transport modeling

The integration provides a foundation for developing truly intelligent nanobot swarms that can adapt to complex tumor microenvironments and optimize therapeutic outcomes.
