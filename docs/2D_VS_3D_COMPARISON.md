# 2D vs 3D Elements Comparison

## ✅ Elements Present in Both Views

1. **Tumor Zones** - Necrotic, Hypoxic, Viable layers
2. **Blood Vessels** - With supply radius and labels
3. **Tumor Cells** - Phase-based colors (viable, hypoxic, necrotic, apoptotic)
4. **Nanobots** - State-based colors and LLM indicators
5. **Nanobot Trails** - Movement paths (in detailed mode)
6. **Substrate Fields** - Oxygen, drug, pheromones, etc.
7. **Grid** - Reference grid lines
8. **Labels** - Zone names, nanobot states, vessel info (in detailed mode)

## ❌ Missing in 3D View

1. **Scale Bar** - Shows domain size (e.g., "600 µm" with a bar)
2. **Substrate Legend/Value Display** - Shows max value and current substrate name
3. **Tumor Boundary Circle** - Clear outer boundary outline (we have wireframe but not prominent)
4. **Comprehensive Legend** - Detailed legend showing all states, phases, and elements
5. **Nanobot State Symbols** - Visual state indicators (→ for targeting, 💊 for delivering, etc.)

## 💡 Suggested Additions

1. **Scale Bar 3D** - Floating scale bar in 3D space or overlay
2. **Value Display** - Show current substrate max value
3. **Enhanced Boundary** - More visible tumor outer boundary
4. **Legend Overlay** - Floating legend panel in 3D space or enhanced UI legend
5. **State Icons** - Visual symbols on nanobots like in 2D
