## 🎬 Demo Script

### **For Showing the Simulation:**

1. **Start on Home**
   - "Welcome to Antelligence - we've added tumor treatment simulation!"
   - Click "Tumor Nanobot Simulation"

2. **Configure (Sidebar)**
   - "Let's set up a 600 µm domain with a 200 µm tumor"
   - "We'll use 10 nanobots for this demo"
   - Click "Run Simulation"

3. **While Loading**
   - "The simulation is running real PhysiCell-inspired calculations"
   - "Modeling oxygen diffusion, drug delivery, and cell death"

4. **First View (Simple Mode + Oxygen)**
   - "See this red circle? That's our glioblastoma tumor"
   - "The pulsing green circles are blood vessels - oxygen and drug sources"
   - "Blue regions inside the tumor have low oxygen - hypoxic areas"
   - "Watch the colored dots - those are our nanobots"

5. **Start Playback**
   - "Nanobots start at green vessels, fully loaded with drugs"
   - "They navigate toward the hypoxic blue regions using chemotaxis"
   - "When they reach tumor cells, they deliver their payload"

6. **Switch to Drug Tab**
   - "Now look at drug delivery"
   - "Green areas show where drugs have been released"
   - "It's spreading through the tumor via diffusion"

7. **Point Out Success**
   - "See those yellow cells? Those are apoptotic - killed by our drugs!"
   - "The treatment is working!"

8. **Switch to Detailed Mode**
   - "For the researchers in the room..."
   - "Detailed Mode shows movement trails and zone labels"
   - "You can see exactly how the swarm is navigating"

9. **Show Charts**
   - Scroll down
   - "Here's our quantitative data"
   - Point to cell phase distribution chart
   - "We're reducing hypoxic cells and increasing apoptotic kills"

10. **Wrap Up**
    - "This combines swarm intelligence from ant colonies with tumor biology"
    - "All logged to blockchain for reproducible science"
    - "And it's all running in your browser!"
